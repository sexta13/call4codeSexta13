# C2C Web Take-Home Assessment

This is the assessment that you asked to do.

Some notes:
 - I have got some css props from facebook site;
 - The last part of the footer there are random "Option X" because I don't think putting the real values really matter for the context of this assessment.
 - The select box have my birthdate as default, and only added 2 more monhts/days/years to choose.
 - In my professional experience, I usually use SASS. Here I just went with simple and pure CSS.
